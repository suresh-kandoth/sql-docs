# SQL Server help and feedback
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md](../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

We're interested in your ideas for improving our products and documentation. We can't always respond personally, but we'll make sure that your feedback gets to the right person or team. 

## I want to give feedback on SQL Server
The SQL Server engineering team keeps a close eye on the SQL Server [User Voice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server). If you want to report a problem with SQL Server, such as crashes, sluggish performance, unexpected behavior, and so on, the User Voice is the best place to do that. 

The [User Voice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server) is also a great place to let the engineering team know what they could do better! If you have any recommendations or feature suggestions, please report it here as well. 

## I want to give feedback about SQL Server documentation
The best way to reach the SQL Server content team is through Git Issues. You'll find an option to submit a Git Issue at the bottom of most of our pages: 

![Git Issue content feedback](media/sql-server-get-help/git-issues.png)

If you have something else to share - an idea, a suggestion, feedback, anything! You can do so by filing a general Git Issue at [https://aka.ms/SQLDocsFeedback](https://aka.ms/SQLDocsFeedback). 

Just select the 'New Issue' button to get started. 

![New Git Issue](media/sql-server-get-help/new-git-issue.png)


The SQL Server content team also frequently solicits survey feedback. If you have some time to spare, please share your experiences with us at [https://aka.ms/SQLDocSurvey](https://aka.ms/SQLDocSurvey).


## I want to make a suggestion about SQL Server Management Studio
The SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) team also closely monitors the SQL Server [User Voice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server) so if you have any issues to report, or suggestions to make, the User Voice is the best place to do so. 

## I want to make a suggestion about Azure Data Studio
The Azure Data Studio team closely monitors issues and feature requests on [Azure Data Studio Github](https://github.com/microsoft/azuredatastudio/issues). Please submit an issue or feature request here, and you can see when the issue/feature will be fixed or added.

## I want to access the SQL Server technical documentation offline
If you would like to view the SQL Server documentation on an offline system, you have two options to do so. You can either create a PDF wherever you are in the SQL Server technical documentation, or you can download the offline content using [SQL Server offline Help Viewer](sql-server-help-installation.md). 

If you'd like to create a PDF, click the **Download PDF** link found at the bottom of every table of contents.

If you're a commercial user, please review the Microsoft [Contact](https://support.microsoft.com/gp/contactus81?forceorigin=esmc&Audience=Commercial) page.
